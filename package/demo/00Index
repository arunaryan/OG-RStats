YieldCurve2	Iterates a view over historical data, extracting the fitted curve from each cycle to produce a dataset for a 3D "fitted curve over time" chart. This uses the code within the main OpenGamma engine and analytics library compared to YieldCurve.R which simply fetches the raw time-series used to construct the curve.
View	Select one or more views to run; this might be a wild-card search string like "*" to run all views (not currently supported in OG-Language)
MarketDataSnapshot	Demonstrates manipulating a market data snapshot programmatically.
Historical	Iterates a view over historical market data to produce timeseries for the portfolio. This demonstrates the functions used to perform the historical iteration; the choice of view and handling the data is arbitrary.
Peturbed	Iterates a view over some historical market data that is peturbed slightly. This demonstrates injecting values into the engine.
YieldCurve	Loads the time-series for yield curve data points to construct a 3D "curve over time" graph.
TimeSeries	Loads a time-series from the database using a Bloomberg ticker
