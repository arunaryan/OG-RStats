Analytics	Demonstrates the full use of the system for performing calculations by creating a security, a suitable view, a market data snapshot from the view, and then executing the view with peturbations on the market data snapshot.
Analytics2	Demonstrates the full use of the system for performing calculations by creating a security, a suitable view, a market data snapshot from the view, and then executing the view with peturbations on the security.
Curves	Demonstrates specifying curve names at the position level. Note that the "out-the-box" example server contains only a single set of curves called "SECONDARY" so the position attributes specified here will be ignored unless additional curves called "FORWARD_3M" and/or "FUNDING" are defined.
Historical	Iterates a view over historical market data to produce timeseries for the portfolio. This demonstrates the functions used to perform the historical iteration; the choice of view and handling the data is arbitrary.
MarketDataSnapshot	Demonstrates manipulating a market data snapshot programmatically.
Peturbed	Iterates a view over some historical market data that is peturbed slightly. This demonstrates injecting values into the engine.
SwapExample	Demonstrates constructing a swap security, specifying all of the market data required and pricing it using the engine.
TimeSeries	Loads a time-series from the database using a Bloomberg ticker
View	Select one or more views to run; this might be a wild-card search string like "*" to run all views (not currently supported in OG-Language)
YieldCurve	Loads the time-series for yield curve data points to construct a 3D "curve over time" graph.
YieldCurve2	Iterates a view over historical data, extracting the fitted curve from each cycle to produce a dataset for a 3D "fitted curve over time" chart. This uses the code within the main OpenGamma engine and analytics library compared to YieldCurve.R which simply fetches the raw time-series used to construct the curve.
